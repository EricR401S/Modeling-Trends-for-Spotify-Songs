## Part 2: Statistical Analysis Plan

In part 2, you will produce a statistical analysis plan. The plan should be at most 2 pages, produced in R
Markdown, and include the following:
2



• Overview: Briefly describe the dataset and research questions.





• Models: Describe the type of model you will use for each research question. Justify your selections.






• Variable selection: How will you perform variable selection for your models? For each research
question, list any variables that you are selecting a priori to be included in your model.





• Challenges: How do you plan to address the challenges you presented in part 1?
An example of a statistical analysis plan is posted in Lessons on Sakai. The “primary analysis” and “sec-
ondary analysis” sections can serve as guides for how to discuss what kinds of models will be fit and why.
