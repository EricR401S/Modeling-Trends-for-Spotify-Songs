# Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs
This is a project in which we will investigate Spotify song data (scraped by Yamac Eren Ay and hosted on Kaggle) to answer two questions of interest. One is what musical attributes boosted the popularity of songs in the 2010s, and the second is to what extent can the musicality of a song predict whether a song is explicit or non-explicit.
