# Abstract: 
A few sentences describing the purpose of the analysis, the data, and key results
#Introduction: Provide more background on the data and research questions. Be sure to cite the data
and background information appropriately (APA style is fine)
# Methods
Describe the process you used to conduct analysis. This includes EDA and any relevant
data cleaning information (e.g., did you exclude missing values? If so, how many? Did you collapse categories for any variables?) Then describe the models you fit, and any changes you made to improve model fit (e.g., did you exclude any influential points? Did you do have to address multicollinearity issues? Did you transform any variables?). Also describe model diagnostics. The organization of this section may depend on your particular dataset/analysis, but you may want to break it into subsections such as “Data,” “Models,” and “Model assessment.” Note that you do not present any results in this section.
# Results
Here you should present results for all aspects of the analysis. The structure of this section should mirror the structure of the methods section. For example, you can start with a few key EDA results (e.g., a table of descriptive statistics), then present model results, then address assessment. This is the section where you will primarily refer to tables and figures. You should have at least 1 figure for each research question that illustrates a key result of the analysis.
# Conclusion
Describe the key takeaways from your analysis, limitations, and future work that can be done to advance knowledge in this area.
