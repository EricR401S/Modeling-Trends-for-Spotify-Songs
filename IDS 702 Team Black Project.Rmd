## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






Subset the data

```{r subset}
#read data
#df <- read.csv("/Users/pr158admin/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/archive/tracks.csv")
df <- read.csv("https://github.com/EricR401S/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/raw/main/archive/tracks.csv")
#subset data
subset <- df[grep('2010.*', df$release_date),]
```




Cleaning

# Two columns of interest : Name of artist (if one wanted to highlight certain summary statistics), duration conversion (get minutes), the rest is perfect on its own.
