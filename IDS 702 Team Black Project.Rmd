## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Load the data

```{r subset}
#read data
#df <- read.csv("/Users/pr158admin/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/archive/tracks.csv")
df <- read.csv("https://github.com/EricR401S/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/raw/main/archive/tracks.csv")
```

Cleaning

# Two columns of interest : Name of artist (if one wanted to highlight certain summary statistics), duration conversion (get minutes), the rest is perfect on its own. 


```{r}

# Removing the brackets from the names of the artists
# This will facilitate summary statistics

df$artists<-gsub("]","",as.character(df$artists))
df$artists<-gsub("^.","",as.character(df$artists))

# New minute variable for our own use to simplify interpretation

df$duration_minutes <- df$duration_ms/(1000*60)


# Optional : Apparently no missing data

colSums(is.na(df))


```

```{r}
# change "explicit" into binary factor
df$explicit <- factor(df$explicit)

# make Date readable to R
df$release_date <- as.Date(df$release_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

```{r subset}
#subset data
subset <- df[grep('2010.*', df$release_date),]
```

Description of Dataset




Definitions of Predictors

*Popularity* is calculated by an algorithm and based on how many times a track has been played and how recent those plays are. This is the response variable that we are interested in this research question 1.

*acousticness* = A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

*danceability* = how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

*energy* = a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.

*instrumentation* = whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

*tempo* = The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

*loudness* = overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.

*speechiness* = Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.

Relationship to Research Questions

In the research, we have two main Research Questions:
RQ1.	What are the musical attributes that gauged the popularity of songs in the 2010s? 
*Dependent Variable (continuous) = popularity*
*Independent Variables = acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentation, tempo, loudness, and speechiness* 
In RQ1, we aim to "infer" what features of music could better measure the popularity.
 
RQ2.	To what extent can the musicality of a song predict whether a song will be explicit or non-explicit? 

*Dependent Variable (categorical) = Explicitness*
*Independent Variables = danceability, energy, speechiness, and tempo* 
In RQ2, we aim to "predict" whether the song is explicit or not by the four features of music: dancebility, energy, speechiness, tempo.
