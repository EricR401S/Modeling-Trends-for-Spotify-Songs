## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






Subset the data

```{r subset}
#read data
#df <- read.csv("/Users/pr158admin/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/archive/tracks.csv")
df <- read.csv("https://github.com/EricR401S/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/raw/main/archive/tracks.csv")
#subset data
subset <- df[grep('2010.*', df$release_date),]
```

```{r}
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```

Cleaning

# Two columns of interest : Name of artist (if one wanted to highlight certain summary statistics), duration conversion (get minutes), the rest is perfect on its own.

Definitions of Predictors



Relationship to Research Questions

In the research, we have two main Research Questions:
RQ1.	What are the musical attributes that gauged the popularity of songs in the 2010s? 
*Dependent Variable (continuous) = popularity*
*Independent Variables = acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentation, tempo, loudness, and speechiness* 
In RQ1, we aim to "infer" what features of music could better measure the popularity.
 
RQ2.	To what extent can the musicality of a song predict whether a song will be explicit or non-explicit? 

*Dependent Variable (categorical) = Explicitness*
*Independent Variables = danceability, energy, speechiness, and tempo* 
In RQ2, we aim to "predict" whether the song is explicit or not by the four features of music: dancebility, energy, speechiness, tempo.
