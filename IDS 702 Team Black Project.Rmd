## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Load the data

```{r subset}
#read data
#df <- read.csv("/Users/pr158admin/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/archive/tracks.csv")
df <- read.csv("https://github.com/EricR401S/Modeling-Trends-for-Spotify-Songs/raw/main/archive/tracks.csv")
```

Cleaning

# Two columns of interest : Name of artist (if one wanted to highlight certain summary statistics), duration conversion (get minutes), the rest is perfect on its own. 


```{r}

# Removing the brackets from the names of the artists
# This will facilitate summary statistics

df$artists<-gsub("]","",as.character(df$artists))
df$artists<-gsub("^.","",as.character(df$artists))

# New minute variable for our own use to simplify interpretation

df$duration_minutes <- df$duration_ms/(1000*60)


# Optional : Apparently no missing data

colSums(is.na(df))


```

```{r}
# change "explicit" into binary factor
df$explicit <- factor(df$explicit)

# make Date readable to R
df$release_date <- as.Date(df$release_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

```{r subset}
#subset data
subset <- df[grep('2010.*', df$release_date),]
```

Description of Dataset




Definitions of Predictors


It is calculated by an algorithm and based on how many times a track has been played and how recent those plays are.


Relationship to Research Questions

In the research, we have two main Research Questions:
RQ1.	What are the musical attributes that gauged the popularity of songs in the 2010s? 
*Dependent Variable (continuous) = popularity*
*Independent Variables = acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentation, tempo, loudness, and speechiness* 
In RQ1, we aim to "infer" what features of music could better measure the popularity.
 
RQ2.	To what extent can the musicality of a song predict whether a song will be explicit or non-explicit? 

*Dependent Variable (categorical) = Explicitness*
*Independent Variables = danceability, energy, speechiness, and tempo* 
In RQ2, we aim to "predict" whether the song is explicit or not by the four features of music: dancebility, energy, speechiness, tempo.



Relationships within data

```{r}
library(psych)

RQ1_relation <- c("popularity", "acousticness", "danceability", "energy", "instrumentalness", "tempo", "loudness", "speechiness")
df1 = subset[RQ1_relation]

pairs.panels(df1)
```

```{r}
RQ2_relation <- c("explicit", "danceability", "energy", "speechiness","tempo")
df2 = subset[RQ2_relation]

pairs.panels(df2)
```
